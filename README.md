Deobfuscate strings obfuscated using the Golang Garble project.

## Description:

This project uses the Binary Ninja disassembly API to find strings that have been obfuscated using the [garble](https://github.com/burrowers/garble) project and emulates their obfuscation routines to recover the original strings. This is very much in the experimental stage.
